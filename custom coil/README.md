# STL models

For stl models, we tried oval, round, rectangle and square shapes. For each model, you need to print 2 pieces of inner part and 1 piece of outer part. Wrap the coil around the outer part, trap it inside inner parts and glue inner parts together. Fill the holes with magets (10mm long, 6mm diameter).
